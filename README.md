# OSRS-Personal-Project

Old School Runescape's "Grand Exchange" is like a faux economy, where thousands of items are traded and sold on a marketplace. With the right timing/foresight, you can profit in the game by buying an item at a lower price and selling it at a higher price, just like in real world market trading.

This project is a small sample of my ability to use python and a few different packages, mostly from the pandas, requests and altair packages.
